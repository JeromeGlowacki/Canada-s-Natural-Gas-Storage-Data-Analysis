This repository analyzes natural gas storage in Canada, based on official Statistics Canada data. Metrics include opening/closing inventories, monthly injections, and withdrawals.
Data Preparation
Raw export from Statistics Canada had months horizontally across columns.
Restructured in Excel (“Setup” attachment) so each row represents a single metric for a specific month and year.
Vertical format allows SQL-based aggregation and trend analysis.
Analysis Performed
Monthly & Annual Changes: Track inventory fluctuations over time.
Seasonality: Identify recurring patterns in storage levels across calendar months.
Annual Trends: Calculate total and average monthly injections and withdrawals per year.
Depletion vs Injection: Assess net storage changes annually to determine whether Canada is building or depleting inventory.
Key Findings
Since 2023, net injections exceed withdrawals, indicating inventory accumulation.
Seasonal trends remain, but recent years show a trend toward net storage growth.
Next Steps / Potential Analysis
Compare storage levels to natural gas prices to assess market impacts.
Forecast future storage levels using historical trends.
Examine regional storage patterns if more granular data becomes available.
